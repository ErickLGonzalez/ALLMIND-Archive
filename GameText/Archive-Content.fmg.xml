The log indicates that the FCS was operating at

It was completely overwhelmed by V.IV Rusty's speed.

The STEEL HAZE appears to be assembled from a Schneider
high-mobility frame equipped with weapons that allow

Notably, Rusty appears to favor kinetic weaponry that
Vespers members would not normally use.</text>

one can identify noise in one corner of the picture
indicative of digital interference...

The well we found in Gallia is going to dry up sooner

We just can't harvest as much Coral as we used to, and

Coral is an organic substance capable of
self-propagation. The speed at which it proliferates
is determined by the density of the colony.
As such, a vacuum would provide an ideal environment
to maximize Coral density and thus growth.

However, one must not overlook the signs of mutations
within the Coral brought about by this density effect;
it is mutations such as these that will bring about
a collapse that humanity has no hope of controlling.</text>

His research has utterly consumed him.

I see no significant difference in performance compared
to what an AI can achieve... How very disappointing.
This experiment was another failure, then.

Regardless, I will have answers. The arrival of ACs

but what essential difference makes them superior?
